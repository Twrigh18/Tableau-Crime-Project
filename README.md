This is . A tableau dashboard file is not provided becasue all the grapgh are done by each group memeber and the screenshots of the grpahs were sent to the slides. The project was done as a group of five including myself

## Most murderous years of both solved and unsloved cases

![](Most Murderous Years)

![](Most Murderous Years 2)

### Visualization/Reasoning 

Visual shows the count of incidents between 1980-2014. The visual is separated by solved and unsolved cases. Line detail was included to show the count of incidents belonging to each state, the gaps show the states with the largest contributions to both unsolved and solved cases. 
Visual type: Area

Chosen because the trend line created at the top of the visualization makes it easy to see the increases and decreases of incidents throughout time.

### Patterns Trends
A steady decrease followed the early 80’s, a small spike in 86, but falls again only to rise dramatically by 1993 reaching the peak of incidents in the US. It falls dramatically reaching the lowest number of incidents in 2000, a slight incline through 2007 but follows a slow decline till the end of the data in 2014. California creates the most noticeable gap between solved and unsolved cases, making it the most incident ridden state according to this graphic. Texas, New York and Florida create the next most notable gaps in the graphic making these the most incidental states next to California.

Why: California is the most populous state in the US which could account for their contribution to the counts, 80’s and into the 90’s introduced a number of drugs to society, drug dealing was more popular, handguns for drug dealers was a new norm, and an increase in use of guns amongst young people was more prominent. There was an increase in police action and policy(1994-Brady Bill) following these rises which led to the decline


## Top 5 Most Murderous States by Decade

![](Most Murderous States)

### Visualization/Reasoning 

Visual shows count of incident broken down by state, which is color coded. Graph includes years 1980-1989 only. States were sorted to include top 5 most incidental states in descending order. Visual therefore shows the most incident states of the 80’s and details the incident count.
Visual type: Square
Chosen to show a size difference between the number of incidents and separation between the states clearly. 

### Patterns Trends

California consistently takes the lead in each decade, as the biggest square, followed each decade by Texas. New York and Florida change rankings by the 2000’s. There are no trends for the 5th state as each decade shows a different state. The top 5 states of each decade had a general decrease in overall incidents progressing through time. EXCEPT for California from the 80’s to the 90’s (increase from 31k to 35k) and the state ranking 4th thought the 90’s and 00’s stayed the same (9k, Florida then New York). Top three states seemed to stay in the same spot each decade, New York was the only main state that fell in it’s standings.

Why: The states that consistently rank high are those with the most population in the US most likely explaining their high numbers(i.e. More people more likely for potential incidents). These states are as follows: California, Texas, New York and Florida. As mentioned in the previous slide certain societal changes between the 80’s and 90’s could have contributed to the increases that were seen in California. A trending decrease could be attributed to a general strengthening of the authority system in each state. As time goes by people learn how to better protect and limit the possibilities of these incidents occurring(i.e. Laws, trainings, technology)


## Incidents by Month in the Deadliest year and States

![](Incidents by Month)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
Visual shows the incident counts in each month in the most incident riden year(1993) in the top 5 most incidental states of that year, color coded(California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Illinois). The incident counts are detailed next to each point. Counts are arranged in descending order showing the most murderous month in the most murderous state in the most murderous year first.

Visual type: Circle
Chosen to show the differentiation between states, also show the variation of incident counts monthly to highlight the most incidental of them all.

### Patterns Trends
Since the data was put in descending order July shows the most incidents compared to the other months. Spring months seem to return the opposite effect as these months are at the end of the visual they have the least action. Based on the graphic, no surprise, California takes the lead with the highest point of 414 incidents in the month of July in 1993, making this the most murderous time and place between 1980-2014. Of the most incident ridden states (California, New York, and Texas) there appears to be a slight trend downward throughout the year. This conclusion could be explained by individuals potentially being more agitated in warmer weather. As the year goes on, incidents decrease. The only month that appears out of place (comparing season to incidents) would be November. This could potentially be attributed to the holiday Thanksgiving that takes place in this month that’s centered around gratitude and reflection. Even though the weather may not be as cool as it could be, people could associate this month with the characteristics of Thanksgiving and alter their behavior accordingly.

## Victim Age/ Count and the Casue of death

![](Victim Age Weapons)

![](Victim Age Weapons 2)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
Visual shows the average age of victims by the cause of their deaths by the perpetrator

Visual type: Bar Chart
 Chosen bar graph to make it easy to see the the victims age.I chose race to narrow down the information

### Patterns Trends

## Race and Victim Count

![](Race and Victim Count)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
Visual shows the number of victims by race by the cause of their deaths by the prepreatrator
Visual Type: Bar Chart 
 Bar chart is the best way to sort out the number of victims and it’s easy to find it

### Patterns Trends
For the age of the victims, most of the victims were in their their 30s and over. As the graph decrease, the victim age count gets younger. The cause of of death in the youngest victims is by drowning.Young people especially children are more vulnerable. Perhaps they don’t have the skills to self defend.

## Female Murder trends

### Visualization/Reasoning 

### Patterns Trends
From observing this, Whites have most victims. Blacks have the second most victims. Both of the victims were caused by handguns. Even though other races have smaller victim count, the biggest cause was handguns

In the United States, it is easy to own a gun. United States also has a second amendment.

## Murder and Manluaghter Solved Rates and Occurrence Rates

![](PNG FILE)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
First visualization is a line graph that measures total victim count (y-axis) by year (x-axis) from the years 1980-2014
Data filters applied: 
Perpetrator Sex: Female
Victim Sex: Male, Female (Separate Visuals )
Animation (Pages Feature) applied by year, shows full history
Total number of deaths by sex, from 1980 to [Selected Year] is in top right corner of each visual
A line graph was chosen to show either the positive or negative trend of murder counts by the female killer over decades. The sexes were stratified in order to compare the different rates in which men and women were killed. 
Each graph was color coded in stereotypical fashion (male is blue, female is pink) for visual clarity
Dashboard users can interact with year selection for visual effect and impact

### Patterns Trends
From the visualization, we can determine that men are killed much more often than women. This is consistent with our other dashboards, even if the killer is not a female. 
Interestingly, the murder rate drops dramatically for men (1980 had 1990 murders while 2014 had 713) while the female murder rate seems fairly static over the decades. Refer to the downward sloping trajectory of the Male Victim visual versus the consistent Female Victim slope. I hypothesize that while
