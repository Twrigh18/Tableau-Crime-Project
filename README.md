![](Most%20Murderous%20Years%202.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 

* Visual shows the count of incidents between 1980-2014. The visual is separated by solved and unsolved cases. Line detail was included to show the count of incidents belonging to each state, the gaps show the states with the largest contributions to both unsolved and solved cases. 
* Visual type: Area
-Chosen because the trend line created at the top of the visualization makes it easy to see the increases and decreases of incidents throughout time.

### Patterns Trends
* A steady decrease followed the early 80’s, a small spike in 86, but falls again only to rise dramatically by 1993 reaching the peak of incidents in the US. It falls dramatically reaching the lowest number of incidents in 2000, a slight incline through 2007 but follows a slow decline till the end of the data in 2014. California creates the most noticeable gap between solved and unsolved cases, making it the most incident ridden state according to this graphic. Texas, New York and Florida create the next most notable gaps in the graphic making these the most incidental states next to California.

* Why: California is the most populous state in the US which could account for their contribution to the counts, 80’s and into the 90’s introduced a number of drugs to society, drug dealing was more popular, handguns for drug dealers was a new norm, and an increase in use of guns amongst young people was more prominent. There was an increase in police action and policy(1994-Brady Bill) following these rises which led to the decline


## Top 5 Most Murderous States by Decade

![](Most%20Murderous%20States.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 

* Visual shows count of incident broken down by state, which is color coded. Graph includes years 1980-1989 only. States were sorted to include top 5 most incidental states in descending order. Visual therefore shows the most incident states of the 80’s and details the incident count.
* Visual type: Square
-Chosen to show a size difference between the number of incidents and separation between the states clearly. 

### Patterns Trends

* California consistently takes the lead in each decade, as the biggest square, followed each decade by Texas. New York and Florida change rankings by the 2000’s. There are no trends for the 5th state as each decade shows a different state. The top 5 states of each decade had a general decrease in overall incidents progressing through time. EXCEPT for California from the 80’s to the 90’s (increase from 31k to 35k) and the state ranking 4th thought the 90’s and 00’s stayed the same (9k, Florida then New York). Top three states seemed to stay in the same spot each decade, New York was the only main state that fell in it’s standings.

* Why: The states that consistently rank high are those with the most population in the US most likely explaining their high numbers(i.e. More people more likely for potential incidents). These states are as follows: California, Texas, New York and Florida. As mentioned in the previous slide certain societal changes between the 80’s and 90’s could have contributed to the increases that were seen in California. A trending decrease could be attributed to a general strengthening of the authority system in each state. As time goes by people learn how to better protect and limit the possibilities of these incidents occurring(i.e. Laws, trainings, technology)


## Incidents by Month in the Deadliest year and States

![](Incidents%20by%20Month.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
* Visual shows the incident counts in each month in the most incident riden year(1993) in the top 5 most incidental states of that year, color coded(California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Illinois). The incident counts are detailed next to each point. Counts are arranged in descending order showing the most murderous month in the most murderous state in the most murderous year first.

* Visual type: Circle
-Chosen to show the differentiation between states, also show the variation of incident counts monthly to highlight the most incidental of them all.

### Patterns Trends
* Since the data was put in descending order July shows the most incidents compared to the other months. Spring months seem to return the opposite effect as these months are at the end of the visual they have the least action. Based on the graphic, no surprise, California takes the lead with the highest point of 414 incidents in the month of July in 1993, making this the most murderous time and place between 1980-2014. Of the most incident ridden states (California, New York, and Texas) there appears to be a slight trend downward throughout the year. This conclusion could be explained by individuals potentially being more agitated in warmer weather. As the year goes on, incidents decrease. The only month that appears out of place (comparing season to incidents) would be November. This could potentially be attributed to the holiday Thanksgiving that takes place in this month that’s centered around gratitude and reflection. Even though the weather may not be as cool as it could be, people could associate this month with the characteristics of Thanksgiving and alter their behavior accordingly.

## Victim Age / Count and the Casue of death

![](Victim%20Age%20Weapons.png)

![](Victim%20Age%20Weapons%202.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
* Visual shows the average age of victims by the cause of their deaths by the perpetrator
* Visual type: Bar Chart
 -Chosen bar graph to make it easy to see the the victims age.I chose race to narrow down the information

### Patterns Trends
* For the age of the victims, most of the victims were in their their 30s and over. As the graph decrease, the victim age count gets younger. The cause of of death in the youngest victims is by drowning.Young people especially children are more vulnerable. Perhaps they don’t have the skills to self defend.

## Race and Victim Count

![](Race%20and%20Victim%20Count.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 
* Visual shows the number of victims by race by the cause of their deaths by the prepreatrator
* Visual Type: Bar Chart 
 Bar chart is the best way to sort out the number of victims and it’s easy to find it

### Patterns Trends
* From observing this, Whites have most victims. Blacks have the second most victims. Both of the victims were caused by handguns. Even though other races have smaller victim count, the biggest cause was handguns
In the United States, it is easy to own a gun. United States also has a second amendment.

## Female Murder Trends

![](Female%20Murder%20Trends.png)

![](Female%20Murder%20Trends%202.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 

* First visualization is a line graph that measures total victim count (y-axis) by year (x-axis) from the years 1980-2014
* Data filters applied: 
Perpetrator Sex: Female
Victim Sex: Male, Female (Separate Visuals )
* Animation (Pages Feature) applied by year, shows full history
* Total number of deaths by sex, from 1980 to [Selected Year] is in top right corner of each visual
* A line graph was chosen to show either the positive or negative trend of murder counts by the female killer over decades. The sexes were stratified in order to compare the different rates in which men and women were killed. 
* Each graph was color coded in stereotypical fashion (male is blue, female is pink) for visual clarity
* Dashboard users can interact with year selection for visual effect and impact

### Patterns Trends
* From the visualization, we can determine that men are killed much more often than women. This is consistent with our other dashboards, even if the killer is not a female. 
* Interestingly, the murder rate drops dramatically for men (1980 had 1990 murders while 2014 had 713) while the female murder rate seems fairly static over the decades. Refer to the downward sloping trajectory of the Male Victim visual versus the consistent Female Victim slope. I hypothesize that while 

## Most common weapon type by female killer’s age and their victim’s relation (1980-2014)

![](Female%20Murder%20Weapons.png)

## Visualization/Reasoning

* This visualization is an area map. It correlates the size of a rectangle relative to the what percentage of the data it represents. It is arranged from left to right in descending order of incidents counts by weapon (and user-selected killer age and victim relationship)
* Data filters applied: 
Perpetrator Sex: Female
Perpetrator Age: [User Selects]
Relationship: [User Selects]
* Each weapon type has its own unique color. Each square labels the weapon and the incident count
* The user-selected filters, killer age and relationship, are drop-down menus for clarity and ease of use. 
* An area map was chosen to give visual impact of the count and popularity of a weapon type. It clearly portrays the dominant percentage of murders committed with guns and knives compared to more novel forms of murder such as drowning or fire.
* The drop-down menus allow users to stratify data into interesting population segments. For example, younger killers may have access to different types of murder weapons compared to older ones. Similarly, users can see how murder types vary between family members and strangers

## Patterns/Trensds
* This is an interesting dashboard to interact with. It becomes apparent that younger killers have less cases of murder, but a more unique profile of weapon types. This may be due to difficulties in obtaining the most popular weapons (handguns) and resort to modes like drowning, knives, or blunt objects. Middle-age women most prefer handguns. Some interesting trends: knives are more popular to kill boyfriends, but guns are more popular when killing husbands. There is also an uptick in death by fire when the relation is “Neighbor” which suggests murderers set neighbor’s houses on fire. 

## Number of Fatal Incidents and Perpetrator Age

![](Average%20Perpetrator%20Age.png)
![](Average%20Perpetrator%20Map.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning
* For this visualization I used a Symbol Map of the United States
* Chosen to show the different states and the different amount of incidents
* Shows the average number of fatal incidents per state from 1980 to 2014

### Patterns/Trends
* The states with the highest average number of instances were: Florida with 218  Illinois with 26.1 Washington DC with 18.8
* This could be due to the states having a large presence of gang activity
* The states with the lowest average number of instances were: Maine with 1 Montana with 1.1 Idaho with 1.1
* This could be due to the states being more rural area than large cities

## Average Preparerator Age

![](Average%20Perpetrator%20State.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning
* For this visualization I chose a vertical bar chart
* Chosen to show the vast differences in ages between the states
* It shows the average perpetrator age by state

### Patterns/Trends
* The States with the oldest average age of the perpetrator were: Montana at 31.04 years old Vermont 30.89 years old West Virginia 30.57
* This could be due to being rural areas and the people get into disputes
* The states with the youngest average age of the perpetrator were: Washington DC at 7.34 years old New York at 13.77 years old and Maryland at 15.95 years old
* This could be due to being states with a lot of gang activity and young people are being recruited 

## Murder and Manluaghter Solved Rates and Occurrence Rates

![](Who%20Is%20Perpetrator%203.png)
![](Who%20Is%20Perpetrator%204.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning

* Visual shows a count of the different types of relationship the perpetrators had with the victims. It also has the data split into two categories, perpetrators caught, or not, for each victim relationship types 
* Visual type: Horizontal Bars 
-Chosen because it visually shows the number of occurrences for each relationship to victim type. It also clearly shows contrast between the number of perpetrators caught and the number of perpetrators who weren't caught in each relationship to victim type.  

### Patterns/Trends
* The overall pattern it is unlikely one would get away with manslaughter or murder. However, a murder or manslaughter committed by a stranger is more likely to get away with the crime. The graph mostly states that “deeper” the relationship the perpetrator has to the victim, the more likely they will be caught for their crime.  
* The reason why there is a relationship between the likeliness of perpetrators getting caught increases with “deeper” relationships. Is that polices look for who had the motive to commit such a crime. It is much easier for police to investigate friends and family for a motive than a complete stranger.  

## Number of solved and unslocced incidents by agency types with weapon used

![](Agency%20Weapon%20Used.png)
![](Agency%20Weapon%20Used%202.png)
![](Agency%20Weapon%20Used%203.png)
![](Agency%20Weapon%20Used%204.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning
* Visual shows the number of solved and unsolved weapon type instances by Agency Type.
* Visual type: Stacked bar chart

### Patterns/Trends
* The most popular weapon type used in murders or manslaughters is a Handgun. The handgun also has the highest solved rate overall. The lowest solve rate by weapon is the knife  
* Why: This not surprising because spent bullets leave a sort of finger print from the gun it was fired from. While a knife on the other hand ones cleaned leaves no traces that it was ever used. That why cops can easily prove that a particular weapon fired the bullet that killed whoever. However, when it come to knifes it can be impossible for the cops to prove a particular knife was used in a murder or manslaughter. 

## Number of occurances of weapon types for each agency type

![](Agency%20Weapon%20Occurence%202.png)
![](Agency%20Weapon%20Occurence%203.png)
![](Agency%20Weapon%20Occurence%204.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning
* Visual shows the number of instances of different weapon type in each Agency Type. 
* Visual type: Gantt chart

### Patterns/Trends
* This data chart clearly outlines the different types of murder and manslaughter that each Agency type typically sees.
* Why: Each of these agencies are grouped by the type of area they patrol. So this chart would show what incoming officers can expect in regards to how crimes are committed in each Agency type. For an example the municipal policies typically deal with firearms and blunt object weapons.  

## Number of Incdients vs Number of Solved Incdents

![](Number%20of%20Incidents.png)

### Visualization/Reasoning 

* Visual shows the number of instances occurred vs the number of instances that are solved for a period of 1980-2014. 
* Visual type: Trend line bar chart

### Patterns/Trends

* This data chart clearly outlines the difference between the number of instances that occured and the number of those instances that got solved. It show a huge drop in solved instances in the year 1999
* Why: There were the least amount of solved instances in 1999 but there was also the least amount of instances overall in that year compared to other years displayed.Further more, the actual solve rates are slightly lower than the average year but not by much. 

## Observations

* Murder trends fluctuate with periods of low and high incidents.
* Higher populated states tend to have higher incidents, warmer months show an increase in incident numbers. Year 1993 and the state of California are the most incident ridden. 
* Women murderers are more likely to kill men rather than woman, but the overall number of incidents has been trending dorwards since the 1980s. Younger female killers are also more likely to use methods other than a handgun to kill their victims. Relationally, there is no consistent trend between type of murder weapon and the personal relationship the murderer has with their victim. Interesting insight: neighbors have higher likelihood of being  burnt to death
* States with a higher number of gang activity tend to have a lower average for murderers
* Most victims were murdered by handguns, aged mostly in their 30s and over. 

## How to reduce murders

1. Better Gun Control such as background checks
2. Community should be getting people to vote on laws and polticatans that will help reduce gun violence
3.  Priotize on mental health like easy access to therpy, medications, hosiptals and change the culture on how others see mental health
4.  HAve more police precesne is good but the big concern is it can be abused to discrimaite and trarget person of color 
5.  Education
6.  HAve community proitize on education
7. Reduce Poverty

All these options are good I beleive th
the best to stop the crime is to fix the reason why prople commit crimes such as homicides. For example if the murder is mental illness then focus on mental health or if tit a gang violence focus on things can be possiitive of the cimmminuity for people dont resort to gun volience.
